## How to copy

If you need just the header, grab the header.html. If you need the footer, grab the footer.html. 

The images are linked to the main osu page.

The style sheet is seperated into four sections: Main, Header, Footer, and Lib answers. No matter what, grab the main. 
After you copy the main, then copy the header or footer styles as you need them. 

Only grab the lib answers styles if you're working in lib answers. They'll mess up your bootstrap.

Note: the mobile menu requires javascript
